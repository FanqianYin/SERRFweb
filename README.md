# SERRF - sytematical error removal using random forest.
a QC-based normalization method for large-scale untargeted metabolomics.

## online
* **address**: http://serrf.fiehnlab.ucdavis.edu
* **functionality**: 
1. use quality control (QC) samples to build SERRF to normalize biology samples and validate samples.
2. calculate relative standard deviation (RSD) on the validate samples to access performance quantitatively.
3. perform principal component analysis (PCA) to access performance visually.

Both online version have only be tested in a limited number of data sets. **If any error/suggestion, please feel free to contact me at slfan@ucdavis.edu.** I'll try my best to answer your question within 24 hours.
