a QC-based normalization method for large-scale untargeted metabolomics.

## online
* address: http://serrf.fiehnlab.ucdavis.edu
* functionality: 
1. use quality control samples to build SERRF to normalize biology samples and validate samples.
2. calculate relative standard deviation on the validate samples to access performance quantitatively.
3. perform principal component analysis to access performance visually.
